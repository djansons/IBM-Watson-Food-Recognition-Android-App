# IBM-Watson-Food-Recognition-Android-App

I developed this app in the Mobile Technologies unit at Uni. Itâ€™s an Android app that sends a picture to the IBM cloud, which returns a JSON file containing the type of food that the picture is of. It stores all the food in a SQL database locally on the phone, so the user can recall the food they have identified.
